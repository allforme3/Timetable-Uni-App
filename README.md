# Timetable-Uni-App
A Simple application that can show a timetable that will be editable for students to add lecturers.
The project needs updating by adding:
1: editible Textboxs
2: unlimited blocks that can enter time , lecturer , room , course
These are the fundimental points that need to be designed in either through a database backend or static
the future aim is too expend not to just university students but for any daily time based events
